RAML is an abbreviation for "Peaceful API Demonstrating Morphological" and is a demonstrating morphological to describe REST APIs with a 
justly humble and effortlessly comprehensible arrangement for together individuals and software organizations. This morphological permits
you to describe possessions, approaches, limitations, replies, media kinds, and additional rudimentary HTTP mechanisms. Fundamentally it 
is a non-proprietary and completely self-governing requirement founded on YAML and JSON. In additional arguments, it permits us to 
inscribe the requirement of the APIs subsequent a normal.
The pronounced benefit of applying a RAML API is that you focus completely on the "contract" that provides the endpoint; this allows you 
to start generating the documentation, which, once ready, provides different generators to generate the basic service "scaffolding" and
even services that return answers, simulated to start our testing.
This methodology favors the testing process, providing us with the faultless situation to use TDD. Essentially, we describe the API, 
inscribe tests to ingest this API and started building the actual implementation and necessary tests to validate both the requirement as 
pronounced.
