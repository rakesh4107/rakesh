RAML which is also called as RESTful API Modeling Language, helps us to manage the whole api lifecycle starting from it’s
design, develop to sharing.It is basically build on top of YAML for describing RESTful APIs and provides all the 
information to describe an API.
RAML can be designed in API designer.
API Designer is a standalone/embeddable editor for RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) written in JavaScript using 
Angular.JS.
By default, the editor uses an in-browser filesystem stored in HTML5 Local storage.
With this tool/editor, we can design our APIs and test it there itself using a mock service with the tool.
Designing RAML for REST API
So, we need to log in into our account to start designing our APIs:- 
If we don’t have an account we can sign up and create one.
In fact we can put our response structure from an example as above or from a schema or even from a data model introduced
 in new RAML 1.0.
We can also put our response format here for different status code.
Testing Our API
Infact API designer platform provides an option to test our APIs that we build in it. In the left side we can see a 
button called Mocking Service, if we on that button, the API will be ready for a mock test. You can see in the code, 
that our baseUri has been commented and a new mock Uri is generated.
